CleanManagerPlus
https://github.com/builtbybel/CleanmgrPlus/releases/

Microsoft will be soon removing the Disk Clean-up Tool (Cleanmgr.exe) from Windows 10 PCs. It is a Windows system tool which lets you delete the unwanted files cluttered in your PC thereby freeing some space on your disk drive. Disk Cleanup isnâ€™t going away immediately but is on its way out the door. Microsoft says it will keep the utility around for compatibility reasons.

Privatezilla integrates the most critical Windows 10 privacy settings and allows you to quickly perform a privacy check against these settings. Active settings are marked with the status "Configured" and indicates that your privacy is protected. The inactive ones are declared as "Not configured". All available settings (currently 60) can be enabled as well as disabled.
