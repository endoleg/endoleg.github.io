If you ever need your external IP in a #PowerShell  script:
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://ifconfig.me/ip").Content

LogFusion is free, but some of the customization of filters, folder monitoring, and customization of advanced automatic column extraction from text files (!) is gated behind a lifetime license ($7 now)
Worth checking out even if you don't buy it the free version is great.
