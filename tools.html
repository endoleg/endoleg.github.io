<p>Microsoft will be soon removing the Disk Clean-up Tool (Cleanmgr.exe) from Windows 10 PCs. It is a Windows system tool which lets you delete the unwanted files cluttered in your PC thereby freeing some space on your disk drive. Disk Cleanup isnâ€™t going away immediately but is on its way out the door. Microsoft says it will keep the utility around for compatibility reasons.</p>
<p>Privatezilla integrates the most critical Windows 10 privacy settings and allows you to quickly perform a privacy check against these settings. Active settings are marked with the status &quot;Configured&quot; and indicates that your privacy is protected. The inactive ones are declared as &quot;Not configured&quot;. All available settings (currently 60) can be enabled as well as disabled. <a href="https://github.com/builtbybel/privatezilla">https://github.com/builtbybel/privatezilla</a></p>
