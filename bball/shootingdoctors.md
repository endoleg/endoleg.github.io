It’s been said that 20% to 25% of a teams scoring opportunities come at the free throw line. This is especially true at “crunch time” of the game.

Main questions:
1. The target: Do you focus on the front top of the rim, on the back of the rim or on the middle?
2. The guide hand: Where is the guide hand placed exactly? Do the fingers and the thumb point up in the air or to the rim when holding the ball/releasing?
3. Position of the shooting hand before releasing: Are middle and/or index finger in the middle of the ball?
4. What do the feet have at the FT line? Paralell to each other or with the weak foot staggered back or turned?
5. How important is bending the knees?

Amberry learned the importance of keeping his shooting elbow in. ("There are only four ways to miss—long, short, left and right," says Amberry. "This eliminates left or right."). Buchautor: Free Throw: 7 Steps to Success at the Free Throw Line

Here is Tom Amberry's 7 steps to success:
1. Feet square to the basket.
2. Bounce the ball 3 times with the inflation hole up.
3. Put your thumb in the channel (grove), your third finger pointing at the inflation hole. Use same grip every time.
4. Elbow in.
5. Bend your knees. The depth of the bend controls the distance.
6. Eyes on the target. Not the front rim, not the back rim, but the middle of the basket, using the full 18 inches for the 9 inch ball.
7. Shoot and follow through.

from Floyd Strain, a sports psychologist in Payette, Idaho, Amberry picked up the trick of visualizing his arm as 15 feet long and dropping the ball into the basket, which helps sustain his follow-through.

from John W. Scott, who produces instructional videos, Amberry learned the importance of keeping his shooting elbow in. ("There are only four ways to miss—long, short, left and right," says Amberry. "This eliminates left or right.")

his advice to always concentrate on the back of the rim (not the path of the ball) when shooting can be especially helpful
His instructions lay out techniques to control all movement, especially the amount of space between the ball and the palm of the hand
1. The target: I teach the back of the rim since you are actually seeing the inside of the
basket when you do so.
2.  The Guide hand: The non shooting hand is held on the side end of the ball. 
3. As you position your shooting hand on the ball with index finger at the inflation hole, the helping hand is on the end of the ball in a comfortable position.
4. The foot of your shooting hand should be in the very middle of the line pointing straight at the middle of the rim.  The non shooting foot can be set anywhere that is comfortable for the shooter.  Comfort is the most important factor after you do the correct basics.
5. Bend knees very little.  The bend of the knees is done solely to coordinate the upper body. The free throw is an upper body shot.  After running up and down the court the legs get too tired to rely on them for the shot.  Just bend enough to coordinate the upper body.

I hope this helps, Coach.  I do have a book out called The Art of Shooting Baskets which can be purchased at most book stores or purchased on Amazon.com.  My video on DVD can be purchased for 29.95 on my web page.

I try to swish every shot unless it is a bank shot. So I am looking at the center of the rim. By looking at the middle of the hoop my target never changes.

I call it a balance hand because that's what it does balances the ball. It doesn't guide the ball anywhere. Thumb should be pointing back towards ear and fingertips to ceiling.

Air valve in between index and middle finger.

I have my feet shoulder width apart. My alignment is toe, tack, target with lead foot. Back foot slightly staggered and open.

Bend and extend. Bigger and stronger muscles in legs, use them.


“If you want to be the greatest shooter in the world it’s simple. You’ve got to do two things. First, you’ve got to shoot with correct form. Then you have to shoot the ball correctly more times than anyone else in the world.”

What Future NBA Hall of Famers Say:
Kobe Bryant, Los Angeles Lakers: “I never miss an opportunity to work with Dave. He’s the best in the business.”

Ray Allen, Boston Celtics: “Dave has not only helped my shooting, but he improved my overall game. He has given me the confidence in all phases of my game.”


The Stats to Prove It (Dave Hopla’s Personal Records):
1234 free throws in a row.
211 high school 3-pointers in a row.
181 college 3-pointers in a row.
78 NBA 3-pointers in a row.

In 2004 he made 98.89% of his shots! In 2005 he shot a blistering 98.20%, making 35,332 of 35,979 shots!

Throughout the clinics he taught in 2005, Hopla hit 35,332 out of 35,979 shots for a 99.2 percentage

During the summer of 2007 he attended 31 camps where he shot 99.19% (11,093 of 11,183)!! A further breakdown will show you that Dave was 260 for 281 from the 3-point line for a percentage of 92.52% and on three occasions he was perfect from the field (263 of 263 on 6/25 at the University of Maryland, 339 of 339 on 7/28 at the CT Starters camp and 272 of 272 on 8/2 at UCLA) during his lecture.

His form shooting routine that he does before every workout:
It consists of starting with one hand (shooting hand) a few feet from the basket and making five shots before moving back a couple feet and making five more and so on. Dave’s last five shots come from the NBA three-point mark. He then adds the support hand and goes through the same routine.


The key in the above is adding the principles below:
Toes to Target: make sure your toes are pointing to the basket.
Feet shoulder-width apart.
Form the letter L with your shooting arm.
Wrinkle the wrist: the skin on your wrist should wrinkle up when you cock it.
Bend and extend your legs.
Make sure your elbow is above your eyebrow.
Hand to the hoop.
Freeze the follow-through.


Shooting Free Throws In Front Of The Best

I stepped to the line, took a couple of dribbles and made my first three free throws. I really wasn’t that nervous because I know I can shoot the ball. Still, there was definitely the feeling of I BETTER MAKE THESE going through me.

I missed my fourth and Dave went into correction mode.

He asked me, “How do you know where to line up at the free throw line?”

I didn’t really know. I just lined up and shot.

He then stepped to the line and showed me the Tac, which is at the center of every free throw line and explained that he lines up there so that he knows he’s in the same spot each and every time.

He then asked, “What do you look at when you shoot the ball?”

Now I know that many people either look at the front or back of the rim when they shoot, but I honestly have never really focused on either. So I told him the truth, that I didn’t really know what I looked at, I just shot the ball.

It was the right answer, kind of!

He said if you focus on the front of the rim, you’re focusing on being short on your shot and if you focus on the back of the rim you’re focusing on being long on your shot. He told me to focus on the center of the basket because that’s where I wanted the ball to go.

He then showed me where he places his shooting hand on the ball. He explained that there are several center points on an NBA basketball, one of them being the valve. So every time he’s shooting free throws the valve is between the index and middle finger of his shooting hand. This ensures that his hands are properly aligned each and every shot.

I stepped back to the line, “Toe, Tac, Target, Find the valve” and began firing away, getting encouragement and reminders to freeze my follow through, along the way.

Dayly drills

NO BALL
- First step in shooting is a good foundation
- Point both feet to the basket
- Slide left foot back to the instep
- Should width apart
- When you get in Triple Threat position, your shoulder must be in front of your feet, and your head in front of your shoulders
- You want your head far enough forward that your heels come off the floor when you bend your knees
- A common mistake is turning the front toe, toe is always to the target


ADD BALL
- Read the ball- relaxed and comfortable hand
- Lock your arm in the form of the letter L with your elbow directly about your foot
- Ball is not directly in front of your face which prevents you from seeing the basket
- Elbow keeps the ball straight
- Get wrinkles in the wrist
- You want daylight between your thumb and index finger
- You should be able to stick two fingers between your palm and the ball (shooting pocket)
- When you bend you are still in the letter L
- When you shoot finish with elbow above the eye- pretend you are sticking your hand in the hoop
- Toe-Knee-Hip-follow through are all in a straight line
- Don’t turn and twist on the follow through
- What is the target?
- Look at the center of the hoop
- Put the ball in the middle of the hole
- Keep your target constant 


SHOOTER WORKOUT
Form Shooting- Start slow and build up to game shots
- One hand shooting- 2 ft. from the bucket- you get the see the ball go in- gives you confidence
- Your head stays in the center of your body
- Then you simply bend and extend
- Hold your follow through with your elbow above your eye
- When you make three in a row take a ½ step back
- Whether you make or miss you have the same form
- Your feet, hips and shoulder are square
- The elbow keeps the ball straight
- Hold the follow through until the ball is through the net
- When you shoot the ball, stay up on the balls of your feet, don’t fall back, all of your energy must be going to the basket
- Spend 5-10 shooting every day with 1 hand
- The further you move out the more power you need, you get that power from your legs
- Non-shooting hand must balance and lift the ball—it does not shoot the ball
- Hand Placement—if your hands came together they would form the letter T
- If you put the non-shooting hand in front of the ball- you cant see the basket
- Palm does not touch the ball on the non-shooting hand 


JUMP SHOT FUNDAMENTALS
- Show the palm of your shooting hand to the passer, arm is already in the letter L and the wrist is wrinkled
- Non-shooting hand—don’t show the palm, put it on the side so that you are ready to shoot
- After the catch you simply lift your arms into the shooting position—“lift the L up”
- You have your legs under you—go meet the ball
- Don’t catch the ball and then bend, step to meet the ball, step with your left leg on the reception—you heel hits the floor first
- Catch—sight target---shoot
- You should release the ball before the top of your jump - When you keep your hands up on the follow through—you keep your body straight
- If you drop the non-shooting hand that is when your body turns
- Keep both hands up on the follow through
- When you shoot the ball your momentum takes you slightly toward the basket, but under control and on balance—do not drift, all of your motion must be toward the basket


Find your focus and use Hopla’s instructions to drop shots like Ray Allen

Elements of the Shot

Staggered Stance

Assume a slightly staggered position with your shooting foot in front. Keep a slight bend in your knees and waist.

Toe to Target

Point the toe of your shooting foot directly at the hoop. Bring your shoulders in front of your toes and your head in front of your shoulders.

Letter L

Form an “L” with your shooting arm; this is the most important element of the shot.

Wrist Wrinkles

Cock your shooting wrist until the skin on the back of it wrinkles. Let only the fingertips of your balance hand touch the ball. Do not apply too much pressure with this hand, or you’ll end up palming the ball.

Elbow Above Eyebrow

Keep your shooting elbow above your eyebrow through the finish.

Hand in Hoop

Imagine you’re putting your shooting hand in the hoop as you release the ball. Keep your eyes on the target; don’t watch the flight of the ball.

Freeze Your Follow-Through

After releasing the ball, freeze your follow-through until the ball hits the floor.

Shoot, Stay and Swish

After you shoot, stay put until the ball goes in. Some guys chase their rebounds, but a good shooter believes he is going to swish every shot. If you run in, the ball could bounce right over your head, back to where you just were.

Drills

Form Shooting

• Stand two feet from hoop with ball in shooting hand

• Using only shooting hand, take shots, adhering to the guidelines at left

• Upon making three consecutive shots, take half step back and repeat

Why it’s money

When you start close to the basket without your balance hand on the ball, you’re forced to keep your elbow up, in the “L” position; if you don’t, the ball rolls off your hand. Make sure you keep your elbow up as you move away from the basket. Otherwise, your arm will flatten out and you’ll start shooting line drives.

Spinout Series

• Assume triple-threat position, where you can shoot, pass or drive

• Toss ball about three feet in front of you with backspin

• Step toward ball, gather it and shoot, adhering to guidelines at left

• Retrieve ball; repeat for 25 shots

• Alternate sets between spinning left, right and straight on

Advanced:

Add head fakes and dribbles as you progress

Why it’s money

This drill helps you overlearn freezing your follow-through. If you get in the habit of dropping your follow-through in practice, when you have time to think, you’ll drop it even quicker in the game, when things are moving faster.

The results were impressive. Palubinskas, whose flawless free-throw shooting can be seen in a nine-minute YouTube clip, taught O'Neal that hand and finger strength is responsible for the ball direction and distance on free throws. The result: O'Neal shot a career-high 62.2 percent.

It's all in the hands and wrists and release position. Says world-renowned shooting coach Eddie Palubinskas, a career 90percent free-throw shooter): "The most important part of the shot is from the wrist to the fingers. The ideal shot pocket is a couple inches above the forehead in front of the eyes. My elbow is out a couple inches prior to the shot, but just before I pull the trigger above my head, I move my elbow under the center of the ball. If the elbow is not under the center of ball it forces different fingers to do the directing of the ball in a straight line."


1. Target: I don't focus on any of those. I focus on the rim totally. It is too hard to watch a small point on the rim in front or back or middle. My mind measures the distance and the most important thing is to make my release straight to the center of the rim. My smartball shooting system teaches more of this complex part in my shooters triangle.

2 MY guide hand is to the side . Guide hand 90 degrees to the palm of the shooting hand. Not on top of ball or below. Big problem for most shooters is they use the left hand and thumb for more power. Bad mistake.

3. shooting hand: Index finger is dead center middle of ball because the index finger is in center of hand triangle

I will send Picture of my smartball. To give you better idea.

4. The feet are irrelevant. They can be either parallel, staggered etc as long as the feet are shoulder width apart and not too close or too far apart. It is a personal preference and can be affected by lack of strength. I shoot my free throws with both feet 1" from the line as are all my jump shots. Etc.

5. The knee bend relates directly with the ball being place in the shot pocket . My knees do not bend till the ball gets near my nose and then the ball is cocked and the knees bend at the same time making it a smooth transition before the release. It is not a good idea to bend the knees and then bring the ball up and go into the shot, Too much movement.


Ed Palubinskas,

NBSA Vice President and a Founding Member

About Eddie P.

“The Surgeon General of Free Throw”, Eddie P. is widely known as the best active free throw shooter on the planet. Still competing today, Ed continues shooting at over 99% in competition and exhibitions.

*Guinness world record in 2005- 1206/1265 free throws in one hour.

*99% free throw shooter for 25 years.

*Invented Smartball Shooting System to dramatically improve shooting skills. *NBA draft 1975.

*Olympic scoring champ 1976.

*2nd leading scorer in 1972 Olympics.

*College All- American at LSU.

*Led all Colleges, Pros and High Schools In free throw % in 1972 with 92.4%. *Selected All- World in '78.

*LA Lakers Shooting coach 2000-1. NBA champs

Best NCAA free-throw shooter (92.4%) with LSU, he developed a unique method of teaching free-

throws and jump shots (www.freethrowmaster.com). He was the personal trainer of Shaquille

O’Neal of the Lakers, Lisa Leslie of the Sparks, and now of Lauren Jackson of the Storm of the

WNBA.

All the mechanics used to complete a free-throw are an exact duplicate during a jump shot. The only

difference is that you release the ball at the top of your jump or just a fraction of a second before you get

to the peak. If you have great springs in your legs then you can shoot whenever you want, because you

have so much time in the air.


BALL HAND RELATIONSHIP

You will notice, we have here a golf glove for better visual application and comprehension. It

also is a good idea to try and practice shooting with a golf glove to get acquainted with “touch” and “feel”

of the actual ball being released. It is where your mind needs to be anyhow and not focused on making

the shot. In this case , the fingers are numbered 0- 4, with the thumb being 0, the index finger being 1, the

middle finger is 2, the ring finger being 3 and the pinky is 4. The green dots signify that the ball should

definitely be in contact with the green dots, and many of you will want the ball to cover the smaller blue

dots, probably because you may have smaller and/or weaker fingers. Notice that no part of the palm

touches the ball, ever. It is a common flaw of all shooters to start closing their hand during the shot

release. You must keep the shooing hand wide throughout the whole shot process, from beginning to end.

The big red dot signifies the final contact by Ed Palubinskas point with the ball and you must be mentally

cognizant of this contact point as you pull the trigger.


FINGER NUMBER SYSTEM IN TRIANGLE

Looking at the back of the shooting hand you will see the numbers allocated to each finger and the reason

for this is to have each finger accountable for physical effort on each shot. You must be able to

trace back the effort given by each finger. There is an individual accountability for each appendage. If you

have never been able to actually tell which fingers have been directly involved and the amount of thrust

power applied by each finger, then you have not been in touch with the finesse aspect of shooting, and

you definitely need some fine tuning. If I would apply a non- scientific percentage of accountability per

finger, then it would be as follows:

? 0 or thumb- provides stability and has about 10% involvement.

? 1 or index finger-This is the big gun. I would allocate about 60% control to this trigger finger. See the

red dot.

? 2 or the middle finger has a surprisingly small amount of control or about 15%.

? 3 or the ring finger is just a stabilizer and has about a 5% role.

? 4 or the pinky finger balances out the triangle with a 10% value. By keeping it wide the pinky provides

width, stability and keeps the ball from “fishtailing”.


“PALUBINSKAS PERFECT SHOOTER’S TRIANGLE”

The basis of the perfect shooter’s triangle is to have fingers, joints and pads numbered so that each

individual part of the hand can be held accountable. The reason the ball misses a lot is because the ball

only responds to the physical effort dictated by the shooter. The ball path does not lie. And Newton’s law

says “For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction”. You are doing something to

make the ball go left or right, long or short. If you don’t understand why, then that is why you wont improve

significantly. “The Palubinskas Triangle” demonstrates appendage accountability. Just lay down on the

floor and shoot up at the ceiling and study your hand and feel which fingers do what. Just shoot

about 2 meters (or 6-8 feet high) is enough. Do hundreds. Next drill, lay under the backboard at 45

degrees to the glass and rim. While laying down shoot the real “lay-up” while on your back and see if you

can make 5 in a row off the glass. You can raise your head off the floor, but keep your back against the

floor. This is very difficult and it will open your eyes by showing you how weak we really are as shooters.

Focus on the perfect triangle and follow through and not on making the basket. This is backwards thinking.

Practice this daily and you will get stronger and more accurate with the right mechanics.


ELBOW LOCATION BEFORE SHOT

This goes along with the perfect “shot pocket”. Where do you actually start your shot from? Is it

in front of the belly, chest, face, to the side near the ear or near the forehead? Your starting point or “shot

pocket” reveals a lot about your shot as far as shooting angles, time of release, time of follow

through, amount of ball rotation etc. The lower the ball is (near the stomachusually younger players with

weak arms and lack upper body strength as well as weak fingers) the more effort is involved in the

“upthrust” and thus there is no room for any “pause” time where you can get your bearings on direction

and distance.


INCORRECT “SHOT POCKET”

By the time this shot is released the elbow joint will have moved about 0,80 meter (or 2 and a half feet)

before it gets to the locked position. If the elbow is not directly under the center of the ball then

this creates inconsistent direction, but not necessarily distance. This action from the stomach or

chest almost becomes a “throw”. If you do shoot with the ball in a low pocket, focus on the elbow and

notice if it is inside (medial) or outside (lateral) of the center of the ball.


KNEE MOVEMENT BEFORE SHOT

Both feet must be shoulder apart, and pointed to the basket, with the right foot about five centimeters (or a

couple of inches) ahead, if you are right-handed (or the opposite if you are left handed). A big reason to

have both feet shoulders apart and “toeing” the line is that the shoulders follow the feet and you become

more square, thus reducing the possibility of shooting irregularities. The knee bend prior to shooting the

ball is only about 12 centimeters (or 6 inches) or about the width of your shooting hand. No major joints

seem to move more than 12 centimeters (or 6 inches) .


GRIP ALIGNMENT

You can actually see a big figure”4” here. One adjustment you can make here is the guide arm

elbow can move to the left if you feel like creating more space or get the defense to foul you on a jump

shot. The center of the ball is nicely distributed through the center of the hand and wrist joint. You’ll be

very surprised how many thousands of players don’t even have this right. Copy this alignment. Shooting is

not about feeling comfortable. Science rules here and it is our duty to create the new scientifically correct

mechanism and thus create a whole new feeling action. You are also re-energizing new muscle memory. I

was not born with my own shooting mechanism. I totally had to learn and re-fabricate or re-engineer the

mechanics so they would abide by scientific and natural laws.


ELBOW MOVEMENT AFTER SHOT

When you have the high (recommended) “shot pocket” near the forehead, it allows you more time for your

“radar” to kick in. Watch the good athletes on their jump shots. The ball is high and as well as being more

difficult to block it gives you more opportunity to shoot for the “bullseye” or the hoop. This will automatically

put your “shotpocket right where it

needs to be- near the forehead. Once in this position all you need to do is lock all the joints namely the

knee, elbow and wrist, only. Less is more here. As the arm locks at the optimal 45 degree angle to the

floor, the actual elbow joint should have only moved about 20 centimeters (6 inches). Test yourself. If you

feel uncomfortable it is probably because you are lacking the strength and or your timing is not

synchronized with the three main joints (knee, elbow and wrist) which gives you the timing and power you

need.


KNEE ACTION AFTER THE SHOT

At the moment the ball is being released the knees and the elbow should be locked or straight. You should

hold your follow through till the ball goes through the hoop while maintaining a statuesque pose. Your

energy should be generated up through the hips and shoulders and not through the forward movement of

the arms.


FINAL FOLLOW THROUGH ON “PALUBINSKAS SHOOTER’S TRIANGLE

”The fingers are numbered and notice they are cupped in the shape of the ball (photo 11). If you connect

the numbers, they will form a dome shape (exactly like the ball) The hand should stay in this shape before

during and after the shot. This seems to be a real difficult task for a lot of shooters for a short period of

time. It is a new process that must evolve if improvement is desired. The blue line must never veer off

center line, ever 2 and 3 fingers should never drop below the line drawn between 0 and 4. In fact, the third

knuckle on the fingers should never bend. The only joint that ever moves on this reengineered follow

through is the wristjoint. This system is highly efficient. It has served me well over the last 20 years. I have

been averaging 99% from the free-throw line for the last 20 years in shooting competitions.


SHAPE OF FOLLOW THROUGH

Here it is important to recognize that the finished follow through has a real shape to it. You can

call it cupped, domed, circular or round. Whatever way you look at it, it does take on the shape of the ball

from where it was just formed, and it must stay this way throughout the shot. The fingers are all spread

comfortably, firm but not stiff, before, during and after the shot. Many players actually move their hand

around on the ball after they catch or pick it up especially on freethrows. This tells me they are looking for

comfort and not specificity. This takes some discipline and practice to re-educate your muscle memory,

but it is well worth the new control that you will feel. Just don’t ever let 2 and 3 break at the three joints on

the back of the hand. If they do they start dominating the shot and you don’t want this.


POOR FOLLOW THROUGH

This image shows me extra tension in the finish of the shot. Notice the thumb of the guide hand. He used

the thumb for extra effort to get the ball there. This action must be eliminated. The guide hand

is only for support of the ball and not to assist the shot or its flight path. This guide hand thumb is a real

detriment to shooting accuracy. Also the shooting hand has completely collapsed. All the 3rd knuckles

have bent, the fingers have lost their width and they are all pointing to the floor. The basket is 10’ high.

You are not shooting at a shadow on the floor. Double jointed players may have a harder time getting

control of all their joints due to their genetic makeup. Strength development does help.

1. target: I prefer the middle of the back rim.
2. guide hand: I prefer on the lower front of the ball, with the guide thumb pointing up.
3. shooting hand: I prefer the hand in the middle of the ball, and in most cases that makes the first and second fingers spread equally in the exact middle of the ball.
4. I prefer the weak foot a few inches back of the line, but there have been many great shooters who had both feet parallel to each other. Be sure the foot under the shooting arm is all the way up to the line, because this is the only shot in basketball where you can shoot it from exactly the same distance every time.
5. Yes, the knees should be bent slightly because your power is coming primarily from your legs.

§ Free throw line: find the nail to get proper alignment with front foot.
§ Line up elbow on catch and pivot, bad catch no shot.
§ Find basket - shoot for just over the front of the rim.
§ Attitude - know you are going to make it, alignment is the key if you eliminate missing right and left you will improve 50 %.

TEACHING TIPS ON SHOOTING
1) KEEP IT STRAIGHT
2) GET IT UP ( 60 DEGREE ARC)
3) HOLD IT HIGH / 1 SECOND FOLLOW THROUGH
4) LAND 6 INCHES CLOSER ( JERRY WEST)

1. I teach to focus in the middle of the basket - great shooters can put the ball where they aim
2. The off hand is placed on the side and the fingers should point up to the ceiling upon release of the shot
3. The middle and index are in the center - no exact position - every player's hand is different size
4. Right foot in front of left foot (for right handed players) slightly tilted with toe pointed towards the left part of the backboard.  Feet should be approximately shoulder width apart
5. Yes bending the kness is important in your shooting motion

target: When on the move focus on the whole basket.  When shooting a free throw you can concentrate on the front of the rim, back of rim or down the middle.  With a free throw you have time to pick a specific point.
guide hand: Most common position with the guide hand is on the side of the ball.  Before lifting the ball the thumb is pointed basically up.
shooting hand: It is incorrect when you try to position the index finger in the middle of the ball where the finger is pointing straight ahead.  This is one of the worst mistakes that shooting instructors make when teaching shooting.  This causes a player to cock the hand and wrist incorrectly which really hurts range.

1. The target is on an arc above the front rim.
2. The guide hand is placed on the side of ball w/ four fingers pointed towards ceiling and thumb towards body. When ball is released guide stays up
3. Position of shooting hand has second joint of middle finder on the hole in basketball where ball is inflated.

Tom Nordland quotes:
- relax the wrist, hand and finger muscles. They don't have to do any powering, steering or guiding. Release the ball with a quick, strong, and constant arm-straightening motion. You'll see and feel a "flop and bounce" of the wrist and hand when totally relaxed.
- spirit of "awareness“ to learn better
- shoot on the way up (free throws and jump shots) from powerful lower/middle body energy - If you shoot earlier, you get: a) More power  b) More height c) A quicker release d) The Release muscles can do less and relax because the bigger lower body muscles are doing more
e) A "stabilizing" effect. The larger muscles create an energy like a rocket blasting off from Cape Kennedy. The Release becomes the Space Shuttle going to the moon
- OVERALL IT'S THE TARGET AND THE FLIGHT OF THE BALL THAT MATTER!
- a shot coming into the basket at a medium high angle of ~45° above horizontal has an effective landing area about 60% larger than for a shot coming in at ~30°. An even higher 60° angle shot (the angle considered most effective by some coaches) has a landing area more than twice as large than that of a 30° angle shot.
- I believe most free throw motions use too many upper body muscles and too few lower body muscles. upward force from the legs!
- If shots are getting only a foot or two (three feet for longer shots) above the rim, then you're in trouble.
- Note that when you have your shooting hand in line with the shooting eye, the elbow will be a little to the right (for right handers). This is normal. Do not force the elbow to be under the ball. If you do, you tilt the hand off the target.
- I advise opening up your stance, with your "strong" foot forward more than the opposite foot, but I'm not interested in how much. Just so you feel balanced and ready. Which way exactly your foot points is not the point, so to speak.


QUICK OVERVIEW

1) Flat Trajectories/Little Use of Body & Leg Power -- Get an overview of the height of your team's trajectories. If the bottom of the ball gets no higher than a couple feet above the rim, you've got a problem.
2) Set Points Too Far Overhead -- Watch where your players bring the ball before releasing it. If it's back over their heads, shots will be flat and hot, controlled almost entirely by the smaller muscles of arm, wrist and hand.
3) Jerky or Stiff Follow Through/Arm Not Straightening -- Watch the shooting arms as your players shoot. If the release action is jerky or stiff, or if the arms don't fully straighten, then the Releases will be inconsistent.
4) Slinging or Throwing vs. Pushing Motions -- Watch how shots are powered. Is it by a slinging or throwing action or by a pushing action? Slings and throws are horizontal, whereas a push can be upward, vertical, and automatically give you height and softer landing shot.
5) Funny Spins -- Observe the types of spins. If you have side spin, dead balls or forward spin, you have another problem. These indicate the use of the wrist, hand and/or fingers in the powering and control of the shot, much less reliable than the larger muscles of legs and body.



A FINAL NOTE: CAN THIS BE INTRODUCED ONCE THE SEASON STARTS?
I say "Yes, definitely," and I'll tell you why. I know many of you don't want to "mess" with your players' shots during the season. You feel that summer is the time for them to work on changes in their individual skills. However, I feel when a change is not complicated and done in a spirit of "awareness," rather than "Do this," or "Don't do that," change or learning can happen any time during a season! Humans are Learning Machines, we're born to learn, and we can learn new things quickly and easily, especially if they're simple and natural. Of course, you don't want to suggest a change the day before a crucial game, or in the timeout before a critical free throw. But in the many hours of a week and over a period of a few weeks, players can learn new things and learn to trust them.

1. The target: We tell players to focus on the rim as a whole. If you pick parts of the rim, you tend to hit that area.instead of swishing without hitting the rim. We want them to Swish the ball and not touch the rim. We sometimes have contests for free throw shooting where you get two points if it doesn't hit the rim and one if it does to stress this point.
2. The guide hand: Where is the guide hand placed exactly? The point here is to have the thumb fairly close to where all the seams come together if you have the main seams lined up parallel to the floor. As long as the thumb is at that point, it is just a matter of what feels comfortable.
3. Position of the shooting hand before releasing: If you line up the air valve of the ball right in the middle of those two fingers you will have it perfectly centered for the shot. Those two fingers are the guide fingers and they should be right at the center.
4. The feet should be staggered or what we call an open stance. If you are right handed, the right foot should be forward and at a slight angle. The two feet should be in an approximate 30 - 45 degree angle
5. Bending knees: This is one of the most important parts of shooting. On a free throw, start with the knees straight, taking your three dribbles. Then, bend the knees and thrust upward shooting on the way up. Do not stop at the top of the motion and flip the ball. Be sure to follow through with the shooting hand and when you release the ball on the follow through, the wrist and hand should be relaxed and kind of flop downward.

http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1012560/index.htm


… I can give you two main ones out of the five parts of the shot.
Number one: When you lift your ball up to shoot, it starts waist-high if you visualize holding a ball. What you’re going to do is raise it up. If you were to lift it to head level or a little bit above, the shape of your shooting arm, between your forearm and the rest of your arm, should form a backward letter ‘L.’ Most kids will take the ball when they start, and the ball will come back to their chest, underneath their chin area. When they were little, that’s what they had to do for power. When you collapse the ball to your body, you don’t get that perfect letter ‘L.’ What you get is a ‘V.’ When you have a ‘V,’ you’re dead. It just doesn’t work. 

The number two factor is what happens with your left hand, or the hand that doesn’t shoot. Ninety percent of basketball players do that hand incorrectly. When you’re done shooting the ball, the hand that doesn’t shoot should not be facing the basket in any way, shape or form. But almost 100 percent of all kids use that hand to shoot, to push. That causes the ball to go off-line, which is a terrible problem most players have. A lot of NBA guys have it, too.  
Buzz Braman, who works with the Orlando Magic, stressed keeping one's eye on the basket.


Buzz Braman

http://www.playsportstv.com/basketball/articles/870/basketball-shooting-tips-from-the-nbas-shot-doctor

Buzz Braman was a youth basketball player with a lousy jump shot when he walked into a gymnasium and had a realization that would change his life.

Braman was practicing as usual when he noticed that his shooting motion consisted of five parts and that his accuracy improved as he focused on performing those parts. In the months and years that followed, he developed his brainstorm into what would become “The Braman Method,” a basketball shooting system that corrects flaws and helps players to become more consistent.

Braman is living proof the system works. He once made 738 consecutive free throws, and at a Philadelphia 76ers rookie camp he hit 246 of 250 3-point attempts, including his first 92 in a row.

These days, he teaches proper technique at his basketball shooting camps, in clinics and in his instructional video. His students range from kids just starting out all the way up to NBA stars like Shaquille O’Neal.

The NBA's first full-time shooting coach discusses his basketball tips for youth coaches and players:

PlaySportsTV: How did you learn to shoot as a kid?

Braman: I actually figured it out by accident when I was 13 years old in a gym one day. I just understood that there were five main parts of the shot, and I kind of sorted it out. You’ve got to understand that my dad is a federal judge. My brother and I were raised to think very logically. And I literally had an epiphany one day in the gym because I couldn’t shoot at all. It was the worst part of my game. But I ended up figuring it out. When I walked out of the gym, I had this new style, a new method of shooting that I did every day for three or four hours at a clip. Within three weeks, it was over. I had it. What I teach NBA players today is what I figured out in the gym.

PSTV: How did you get into basketball coaching?

Braman: When I was done playing ball, I was in the car business in Miami for 10 years until I had the brainstorm one day. The NBA stats were so bad – field goal percentage and free throw shooting. I was just thumbing through a magazine and thought, ‘Oh my God, that stuff I figured out way back then, I could turn it into a business.’

PSTV: What kind of youth basketball drills do you do?

Braman: I do camps. I love working with kids. I’ve been doing that for 18 years. One of the main reasons why 99.9 percent of all kids can’t shoot is because you can’t take a 7-year-old kid to a 10-foot basket with a normal-sized ball. The first thing they’re going to do is put one hand on side of the ball, put the other hand on the other side of the ball, then take the ball to their chest and heave it with both hands. So the bad habits start really early, and very rarely do they get broken.

PSTV: How much of the basketball drills involve correcting bad habits?

Braman: I don’t want to say that’s all it is, but it’s 99.9 percent. If you have perfect form – and most of the people involved in basketball have no idea what it is – you’re going to shoot the ball at such a high level it’s frightening.

PSTV: What’s a good age for kids to start focusing on their basketball shooting?

Braman: I think you can do it at a young age, 8 or 9. I had a 9-year-old I taught, and after three months of reconstructing his shot he made 43 foul shots in a row on an eight-and-a-half-foot basket. But he was pretty focused and he loved it. The problem is, when kids are really young, the game should be fun. Kids shouldn’t feel like they’re working and that it’s torturous when they’re playing basketball. Ten or 11 is a really good time to lock in what’s correct.

PSTV: What are some of the essentials of basketball shooting?

Braman: I can’t give it all to you, but I can give you two main ones out of the five parts of the shot. Number one: When you lift your ball up to shoot, it starts waist-high if you visualize holding a ball. What you’re going to do is raise it up. If you were to lift it to head level or a little bit above, the shape of your shooting arm, between your forearm and the rest of your arm, should form a backward letter ‘L.’ Most kids will take the ball when they start, and the ball will come back to their chest, underneath their chin area. When they were little, that’s what they had to do for power. When you collapse the ball to your body, you don’t get that perfect letter ‘L.’ What you get is a ‘V.’ When you have a ‘V,’ you’re dead. It just doesn’t work.

The number two factor is what happens with your left hand, or the hand that doesn’t shoot. Ninety percent of basketball players do that hand incorrectly. When you’re done shooting the ball, the hand that doesn’t shoot should not be facing the basket in any way, shape or form. But almost 100 percent of all kids use that hand to shoot, to push. That causes the ball to go off-line, which is a terrible problem most players have. A lot of NBA guys have it, too.

PSTV: Which NBA players should youth basketball players watch to understand good shooting form?

Braman: Back in the day, I would have told you to watch Chris Mullin. He was probably the best shooter in history. He was not pretty good; he was great. Today, if you were watching on TV, Rip Hamilton has pretty good form. Ray Allen has pretty good form, too.

· Put index finger on the air valve with shooting hand

· Put guide hand on other half of the ball, under the equator

· Focus on the hook in the center of the rim. Shoot the ball "Easy over the near rim."

· THUMB, INDEX AND MIDDLE FINGERS DO THE WORK

· guide hand not too close to your shooting hand à When holding the ball at your waist, you should be able to see only the thumb and top of the index finger on your guide hand

· for the shooting hand, you should never be able to see the pinky—because if you see your pinky, you throw your elbow out

· on your guide hand, your thumb should be aimed not in the air, but towards the target. In other words, in a shake hands position

# 1 Target: Eyes focus on the same spot everytime to shoot the ball...it could be the front or back of the rim, the middle of it..point is to keep the body in the same position every time you shoot the ball. I always tell kids to pick their "own target spot".
# 2 The guide hand: We use a letter to describe the position of the two thumbs on the ball...they spell the letter "T"...as I am a right hander, my right thumb is the lower stem on the T...my left hand is my guide or balance hand so the thumb is the top of the T...they don't touch unless I had very long fingers. We teach pointing the 4 fingers on the shooting hand up in the air and the thumb on the balance hand points over my left shoulder...and the guide hand stays in that position thru the entire shot while the shooting hand finishes high and pronates thru the ball.
# 3 The shooting hand: I like to put my index finer on the air hole if the ball has one lined up with the seams...some people put their index and middle finger spread outside the air stem...either is fine. One other point of interest..listened to Steve Alford...now a college coach in the US...was a great shooter in college as well as in the Pro's..he teaches shooters to always grip the ball on the seam...your 4 fingers on your shooting hand...played with it a bit...not hard at all and makes it easy to check your own backspin on the ball.
#4. I like the feet slightly staggered...about toe(weak foot) even with the instep on the shooting foot. Reason is it allows a slight turn in the upper body which allows the shooter to shoot a little off center...which I believe is needed...because if the shooters feet are even and the shooting arm is reasonably straight and the elbow is under the ball, the ball is about even with the right shoulder...not balanced very well. The staggered position also loosens the shooting shoulder while the ball is closer to the middle of the chest...I like to bring the ball up even with the outside corner of the shooting eyebrow..if I were going to scratch the skin, it would leave a trail touching my eyebrow...which it will not. Because of the staggered stance, I also teach the 2 count stop mostly because I find it much easier to teach young shooters to stop with a little easier balance than if teaching the one count stop. But all a shooter needs to do is stop on balance...so I wouldn't change one that already does it well however.
#5. Knees must be bent if you need any shooting power as that is how you gather it so you can use it. It is also very important as good shooters have good power and a shooting rythem. Have a young shooter shoot a free throw with knees "locked" and notice how much of a low, flat shot they shoot...lack of power is what it is. Good shooters all have 1 item in common...they shoot the same shot again and again. You can't change your foot position, or the arch on your shot, or the position of your shooting or balance hand on the ball, or you follow thru, etc., etc. as that changes the shot. Good shooters keep the ball straight(inside portion of rim on both sides), keep it high enough(50-60 degrees) and get it over the front of the rim and give maybe 95 or 97 of 100 shots a chance to go in. That comes only with consistency in technique.

1. I do not teach target. I believe that shooting is a kinesthetic skill, not a visual one. I believe you shoot by feel, not by sight. I often teach players to shoot with their eyes closed. I want them to concentrate on form and feel, not whether it goes in or not. Given enough repetitions, they learn to adjust their feel for distance. I can routinely make 80% from the foul line with my eyes closed. That is based on that the monstrous amount of repetitions I have had in my life. I don't expect young players to do that but it serves as a good illustration. Pro players routinely shoot for a higher percentage that I do. The direction of flight is determined by your follow through. Just follow through straight at the rim. To be more traditional, why not aim for the hole? Isn't that where you want the ball to go?

2. When it teach shooting, early in the process I teach it 1 handed, with no guide hand. Once we add the guide hand, I usually stress comfort. As long as the ball is steady and and your guide hand doesn't interfere with the ball and shooting mechanism, you can place it however it is comfortable for you, as long as it is the same every time.

3. To be honest with you, I don't know where those fingers are. Al I want is for your hand to be behind the ball (as opposed to on the side) and in the same place every time. Again, it is a feel thing.

I do not get into the really picky little things, such as what direction your fingers face or making everyone put there hand in the same place. It will be different for different people. I think that the most damaging aspect of any skill, which coaches seem to add to, is "analysis paralysis." That is an American saying where you worry so much about the little things, you examine what you are doing so much that you paralyze yourself and can't perform the skill at all. I prefer to remain focused on the big picture. If adjustments need to be made, make them generally. For example, I will say, "put your hand under the ball," instead of "put your hand here." I want players to shoot without thinking of anything. The more minute you get with technique, the more they think about and the less effective they become.

As I said, I don't know if that helps you. It is also a hard discussion for 1 email but I hope I have made things better for you and not worse. I write for a website, www.breakthroughbasketball.com, and we have a lot of great teaching things on there. You might find some other insights.

 


Chip Engelland (Spurs shooting coach and has coached Steve Kerr)
… asked him what he considered some of the key fundamentals in shooting mechanics.
He told me the following:
1. Feet shoulder width.
2. Release should be a one-handed pushing action (Tom Nordland teaches this).
3. Hold your follow through until the shot goes in the basket.
4. When in doubt, shoot!
Lately, I have been researching a lot trying to find the best way to shoot and to teach shooting. There are so many conflicting theories out there.
cengelland@attcenter.com

 


Mark Price (picture perfect jumpshot form and shooting coach of the Memphis Grizzles)
http://www.ssasports.com/shooting%20lab/index.html
Line up correctly. Says Mark Price, the NBA's all-time free-throw percentage leader: "Stay off the line until the ref throws you the ball. Then, walk up, get your feet set and then develop a routine. Free-throw shooting is different than any other shot you take. You're stopped. Everybody is staring at you. It's just you, the basket and the ball and you have to kind of create your own rhythm. Only way to do that is develop a routine."

#1 Target: I tell my players to hit the net just inside the back rim.Up in the air for
#2.The guide hand: Where is the guide hand placed exactly? Do the fingers and the thumb point up in the air or to the rim when holding the ball/releasing? Yes on
#3. Position of the shooting hand before releasing: Are middle and/or index finger in the middle of the ball? It is a little hard to explain in this way but it is real close.
#4 + #5: bending the knees and strong foot forward are part of our process



Anne Lapray
anne.lapray@campcascade.net

1. The target: I prefer the back of the rim - consistancy - and not pulling head or shoulders back (just the slightest) can alter the arch of the ball.
2. The guide hand: the guide hand is on the side - the shooting thumb and the guide thumb would form a "T" if connected when the ball is held in shoting hand put then ball drop down in front of waist. You want to make sure that the guide hand is just that a "guide" not too far in front or too close and behind the ballDo the fingers and the thumb point up in the air or to the rim when holding the ball/releasing? I think the main conern here is that the guide hand fingers do not turn in - again I prefer that you the guide hand palm stays center facing and not facing the basket as you shoot... give yourself a high 5 - no you don't want the shooting hand to hit you guide hand. But the shot is also still very fluid and towrds the basket.
3. Position of the shooting hand before releasing: might be best to say before release ball is in triple threat and behind the ball and the index finger is usually lined center I hope that this is helpful.

1. Target: I teach focus on the front rim and then we get them thinking "high and soft"
2. The guide hand: The guide hand is on the side of the basketball with the two thumbs being only about a inch apart. When holding the ball the thumb and fingers point up and on release they stay the same. The worst shooting error we get is when the young shooter pushes with the guide hand thumb. If the guide hand finishes facing the hoop then you have a major flaw. The guide hand cannot follow through.
3. The shooting hand: The perfect spot for the index finger is on the valve where you inflate the ball. We teach the shooter to look at the back of the wrist and see the wrinkles in the skin. The ball must be laid back this way to get power. Power comes from the legs and getting the wrist and arm in a power position.
4. The three main principles we teach once the youngster holds the ball correctly are: feet perfectly facing the hoop, we teach a one two stop with inside foot stopping first. Then is "pocket"-setting the ball in the same spot each time. Then is follow through, high and soft and hold the follow through until the ball goes through the hoop. We call this sighing your shot."signature"

In his book The Physics of Basketball, John Fontanella explains the proper form for a free throw in basketball. As you push the ball to release it when your arm is fully upward, you should also flip your hand forward about the wrist, so that your fingers are pointed forward as the ball leaves your hand. The technique is undoubtedly correct, but why is the wrist snap needed? Can’t you simply throw the ball to the basket as a shot putter hurls a shot?

The idea is to put back spin on the ball, so that the top rotates toward you and the bottom rotates away from you. You produce such a rotation when you snap your hand forward about your wrist because the frictional force from your hand on the bottom of the ball is in the forward direction.

Good players know that back spin increases the chance of the ball going into the basket. It can somewhat affect the flight of the ball but the primary advantage of the spin is to help slow the ball if the ball hits the rim. When the ball reaches the rim, you want it moving slowly so that it does bounce away from the basket. However, by then the ball has gone past the high point in its trajectory and is picking up speed.

The backspin can reduce that speed via the frictional force on the ball from the rim. The speed of the ball’s center is typically 5 meter per second, and the speed of the bottom of the ball relative to the center is about 1.5 meters per second in the forward direction. When the ball hits the rim, the colliding surface tends to slide forward, and the frictional force, which opposes the sliding, is in the backward direction (back toward the player). That backward force slows the ball, so that it might then fall into the basket.

According to John Fontanella, author of the book "The Physics of Basketball" the physics say to try to get the ball right up OVER the front rim.

I like to keep shooting the basketball as simple as I can as well as leaving it open for some individual preference in terms of how it feels for a player especially concerning the placement of the guide hand on the ball.

1. Target: I just tell players to keep there eye on the "area" of the rim and keep your eyes there throughout the shot. Don't lift your eyes to follow the ball, which many players do. The spot where you want the ball to go is just over the front of the rim, but there is nothing there to focus on but air. So I just ended up saying to players to keep there focus on the area of the rim and that seems to work fine for them.
2. guide hand: I think a player needs to find a place on the ball that feels comfortable to them so it is not interfering with the shot, but just guiding the ball up to the release point. A guideline however would on the side of the ball. I don't think it matters if the fingers are pointing up or to the rim. My fingers on my shot point more to the rim, but I have seen many players shoot very well with their fingers point more up. A player should also learn to catch the ball with their fingers/hands already set to shoot when they receive the ball. I call it "catch it clean".
3. shooting hand: All I tell players is to put their hand directly behind the ball and also learn to catch the ball like that as well, ready to shoot when they receive the pass. I hope this helps somewhat.

(1) target: What to focus on is open to debate. Gary Boren, free throw shooting coach for the Dallas Mavericks (www.basketballshootinginstruction.com ), teaches his players to aim for the exact middle of the back rim. According to John Fontanella, author of the book "The Physics of Basketball" the physics say to try to get the ball right up OVER the front rim. Focusing on the front rim should be avoided because the majority of misses are short. In addition, according to research by Dr. Joan Vickers (www.kin.ucalgary.ca/nml and http://www.coachesclipboard.ca/index2.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=11&Itemid=66 ) the most important aspect of free throw shooting is to focus intently on one location for 1.5 seconds before shooting. (This may be more important than what you chose to focus on.)

(2) The guide hand should be placed on the side or the side front of the ball. In theory, the fingers and thumb should point up and remain perpendicular to the backboard. However, some great shooters (Larry Bird, for instance) turned their guide hand toward the rim as they shot. The real question is - does the off-hand cause deviation right or left? The determining factor is often the position of the shoulders. When the shoulders are square to the basket, the off-hand must stay perpendicular to the backboard during the shot or the off-hand can cause deviation. When the shooting shoulder is somewhat forward then the shooting hand is naturally on the ball longer and the off-hand does not interfere with the flight of the ball. All great shooters have their shoulders angled slightly as they shoot. The fingers and thumb should point skyward.

(3) shooting hand: This question is more complex. The proper hand placement on the ball is directly related to which finger or fingers touch the ball last. Hand placement on the ball is a VERY important element of shooting. This is covered in detail in our "SECRETS OF SHOOTING" video which is available at www.secretsofshooting.com . Go to our "Shooter's Touch" page and you will see there are four basic release points (in our text, the middle part of the hand is referring to the middle finger). The factors involved with a player's proper hand position on the ball are hand size, finger length, and their release position. (Once I determine a player's release point, I can then address their proper hand position on the ball.) One characteristic of all good shooters is when they release the ball, their hand is moving directly toward the basket. To send the ball straight you must have the proper hand position on the ball. Sorry there is not an easy answer to this question but recent research has proven that each player's hand placement is different. Once you find a player's unique hand placement, you will see a dramatic improvement in their ability to shoot the ball straight.


(4)+(5)The feet should be staggered with the off foot pointed out 15 - 20 degrees. The reason for this is it supplies better balance front to back. Start from a relaxed standing position and as you bring the ball up to shoot bend your knees equally to provide as much power as you need.  This  establishes consistency, which will help in late game situations when players are fatigued I favor parallel. The weak foot back causes me to miss left more frequently

1. The target: I have found focusing on the front of the rim, like a laser beam, works best for me and my students. From the moment you locate the rim, stay focused on it until the ball goes in or misses. I can't emphasize enough how important it is to concentrate on the target. When I say front of the rim, I mean that part of the rim closest to you depending on which part of the court you are shooting from.
2. The guide hand: It's hard to explain exactly where the guide hand is located without a visual reference so I won't get into that. Imagine this, you have just released the ball and your guide hand fingers are pointing to the ceiling in a 90 degree fashion...the floor is 0 degrees. Rotate them forward toward the basket, at a 45 degree angle, and in between 45 and 90 degrees is what I believe to be the best angle to point your guide hand fingers at release.
3. Position of the shooting hand before releasing: I would say the middle of the ball is in between the index and middle finger. The dominant three fingers used in shooting are the index, middle, and ring finger with the index and middle being the two most important or the last to leave the ball.
4. Foot: With my shooting technique, the feet are staggered at the line as well as all other shots.  Yes, the weak foot is staggered back and it can turn a little, but not too much.  Make sure your stance is comfortable, balanced, and allows the easiest movement when bending your knees and jumping or rising to your toes.
5. bending the knees? Bending your knees is a very important step in the One Motion Shooting Technique.  The knees start in a flexed position prior to shooting.  When shooting, they go down and up in a quick manner.  Many students will stand too straight legged while waiting for the pass.  When they catch the ball, they bend their knees too low and too slow vs. down and up quickly.  It's a quick jump like when jumping for a rebound.  The speed of your leg action (knees down and up quickly) is usually equal to the speed of your arm movement during the shooting process.

You have asked some very good and detailed questions. My main concern in shooting is to have students shoot with a continuous motion without stopping along the way. Many shooters will pause at the top of their head or shoulder area then continue their shot. To me, that slows you down and breaks the momentum flow. I try to produce in students a quicker and smoother release. It is good to get detailed and technical while teaching form to students, but too much can cause them to think as they shoot and that will not work. They must turn their brain off and just shoot without thinking.

1) target: When shooting the ball, I tell my players to look at the middle of the basket. Now it's impossible to actually see in the middle while you're shooting, unless you jump as high as LeBron James of course, but this is more of a mental thing. I want my players to see the ball going through the middle in their mind. If you look at the front of the rim or back of the rim and hit your target, how many points do you get for hitting that particular target???? ZERO. Shooting is 90% mental in my opinion. You need good technique for the most part, but if you cannot see yourself making shots, chances are you won't!
2) guide hand: I think the guide hand should be placed on the side of the basketball. I often see players move their guide hand slightly in front of the ball, which will cause a poor rotation on the ball and take away power on the shot. I want to see the fingers of the guide hand pointed directly in the air while the ball is in your hand and after the release. The thumb of the guide hand should be pointed back towards the shooter. Furthermore,the thumb of the guide hand and the thumb of the shooting hand should form a "T," but should not touch each other.   
3) shooting hand: I like to have my index and middle fingers toward the center of the basketball. After releasing the shot, the most important thing to remember is that these 2 fingers should be the last thing touching the ball, and should be pointed toward your target. Traditionalists say that the ball should not be on the palm of your hand. I do not emphasize that with my players as much because when they catch the ball in a game, they do not catch it with their finger pads, it's with their entire hand. They need to be able to make the transition from having the ball on the ball to getting it onto the finger pads before releasing the shot. Make sure you are working with your players on having their wrist "cocked" and ready to shoot on the catch.

 


The Art of Shooting with Dr. Tony Pappas - Waterloo West High

Tony Pappas and the Art of Shooting. It had some great tips on developing better shooters.

3 Core Shooting Concepts:
- technique
- repetition
- mental aspect

I've always said that to be a good shooter, just requires practice. But shooting is like golf. There are a bunch of guys that have unorthodox swings, but play in the PGA, because they practice so often. But if you have a good swing technique combined with practice, you'll be that much better. Jim Furyk is a great example, terrible swing form, but because he practices, he's good. Tiger Woods, perfect swing form + practice = best golfer in the world.

The other concept here is degrees of difference. Sometimes there are different points of emphasis, or slightly different ball/body position. However, the fundamentals stay the same.

Body Position:
- 10 toes pointed to the basket
- hips + shoulder squared
- feet placed directly underneath shoulders, not too wide, not too narrow

Ball Position:
- hand placement on the ball in the center
- check for air b/w ball and palm
- ball should be on pads of fingers, never too high, never too low like on resting on the palm
- thumbs should form a T (can touch or not)
- palm to the sky, arm should form a 90-degree angle

The Shooting line:
- toe, knee, elbow, ball
- There should be an imaginary line that goes from the floor, to the toe, thru the knee, up to the elbow and to the ball

The Shooting Pocket:
- shoulders, elbow form the shooting pocket
- tight and tucked, very important
- eyes over the ball, see the rim

Eyes Thru the Window:
- Eyes focused on the rim as the ball goes up looking thru the arms
- Don't follow the arc and path

Push, Down and Out:
- with middle finger first, then forefinger, hold the release

Release:
- finish with the elbow at the eyes
- finish on top of the toes then back down on the heels

Another neat concept is to use tape and make lines, both on the court, and a big one on the ball. That way, you can see if the shooter is in the right alignment all the way through.

First--everyone is different on what  they focus on when they shoot.  Some focus on the front of the rim, some on the back of the rim, some just in the general area.  The key is you must keep your focus on the rim even through the follow through.  Second our guide hand (off hand) is pointed towards the rim--fingers toward the rim and thumb tends to be up.  Third the shooting hand tends to be palm to the sky on the lift and then on the follow through we put our fore finger through the rim and our other fingers pointed to the floor--four to the floor.  I teach and people are different on this point, that the air valve is centered in our shooting hand--so I teach have the valve between the fore finger and the middle finger--this tends to center the ball in the shooting hand.  Once again some people have a different philosophy on this. Foot placement once again is addressed in degrees of difference.  They almost never have to be perfectly parallel or even--but most time close.  If you are right handed your left foot may be back slightly and slightly open.  Secondly your knees must be bent and then when you lift into your shot you rise up to the tips of your toes and unflex your knees.

Basic mechanics of shooting include sight, balance, hand position, elbow-in alignment, shooting rhythm, and follow-through
Set the ball on the shooting side of your head between your ear and shoulder with your shooting hand facing the front of the rim. This will enable you to shoot with your arm wrist and fingers going straight toward the basket.

Trigger Words

Words that key the correct mechanics of your shot are called trigger words. Examples of trigger words are:

• High! - to start your shot high and prevent lowering the ball.
• Straight! - to make your shooting hand go straight to the basket and stop turning your wrist.
• Front! - to key the position of your shooting hand facing the rim.
• Point! - to key the correct release of the ball off your index finger.
• Up! - to key a high arch.
• Through! - to key any part of your follow-through including shoulders, arm, wrist, and finger.
• Head in! - to key the follow-through of head and shoulders toward the basket and prevent leaning back or stepping back.
• Legs! - to key the use of your legs.
• Down and up! - to key the down and up action of your legs for rhythm and range.

Free Throw Shooting Drill 1. Shoot 100 Free Throws

Shoot 100 free throws by performing 10 sets of 10 each. Record the free throws made out of 10 attempts. Your immediate goal is to make 10 consecutive free throws in a set. Your long-range goal is to improve the number of free throws made out of 100 attempts. To be a 70 percent free throw shooter you goal is to make 80 out of 100. To be an 80 percent free throw shooter, your goal is to make 90 out of 100. To be a 90 percent free throw shooter, you goal is to make 100 consecutive free throws.

Steve Nash
of the Phoenix Suns is one of the best free-throw shooters in the NBA. I‚m surprised that struggling FT shooters don‚t emulate his practice of taking two without-the-ball practice strokes before each attempt.

Like a golfer who takes a practice stroke or two before each putt or a full-length practice swing before each drive, Nash pantomimes his stroke. After two pantomimes, he requests the ball from the ref. Nash accomplishes several things with the practice strokes:

He gets himself in a free-throw mindset;

He breaks down any tension in his arms or legs;

He breaks down any tension in his arms or legs;

He rehearses and grooves his beautiful stroke;

He focuses on his target and visualizes the ball swishing through the net.

Many fans have wondered if Nash visualizes the same thing on each of his pantomime strokes. He does not. His first visualization is what we have just described, but on the second practice stroke this good-hearted Canadian with the fan-friendly, swashbuckling style visualizes world peace.



Kyle Macy
Get a routine. Says Kyle Macy, two-time NBA free-throw percentage champ, whose routine had seven steps including drying hands on socks, taking the ball, making sure the label faced him, dribbling three times, taking a set position with a deep breath, bending low and checking elbow to make sure it's close to body and touching the leg, and rising and shooting: "A lot of people thought I touched my socks because I wanted to dry my hands, which I did. But moreso by being down there, it helped me get my focus. I wasn't looking around checking out the cheerleaders or band. You just bring your focus in. You put yourself in a trance. You talk yourself through the process. I'd say, 'After I wipe my hands, I'm going to take three dribbles, I'm going to come to a set position, take a deep breath.' One of my little quirks is that I always liked to have the ball facing me so I could read the label. I'd spin it that way."

Quiet Eye Free Throw Shooting
In one study, Vickers and her colleagues trained members of a university basketball team in the quiet-eye method over two seasons of league play. The players were shown their gaze on video, which was compared to the gaze of elite athletes performing the same task. Then they were coached to shoot free throws using techniques based on the quiet-eye approach, and their results were compared to a control group. By the end of the second season, the quiet-eye team members improved their free throw shooting accuracy by 22.6 percent. The quiet-eye-trained team also improved its FT shooting ranking from seventeenth nationally to second.

Coaching Points
Below are the coaching points emphasized for shooting free throws using the quiet-eye technique.

1. Take your stance at the line and orient your gaze to the hoop as soon as possible. Fixate the hoop (stare at the hoop) even as you carry out your pre-shot routine.
2. Hold the ball in front and fix your eyes a single location on the hoop (front, back, or middle) for about one second. Stability of the quiet eye on one location is crucial. Visualize the ball going into the basket.
3. When ready, shoot the free throw so that the ball and your hands travel up through the midline of your body. The ball will briefly block your line of sight as it enters field of vision workspace. Learn not to watch the movement of the ball or your hands during the shooting motion. Do not move the ball to the side.
4. Shoot using a quick, fluid motion.



Bob Topp (National Director for Shot Doctor Basketball )

1. Target: The research and articles I have read point to the need for a very specific visual target. Ultimately, that target is in the middle, the place we want the ball to go, but to see that is not easy. Use the back net hook as the visual target. Train players how to focus on just that and see through the arms of defenders. Many shots are missed for not having that tight visual target.
2. The guide hand, which we call the off hand, needs to be on the side of the ball with fingers pointing in the general direction of the basket. The important thing with the off hand is that it gets OFF. The most common shooting flaw that I and other shooting experts see is the off hand helping push or propel the ball. This fights the shooter's need to shoot the ball straight. The off hand would be pushing the ball across the hand a bit and the shooting hand has to fix that or have it miss to a side. The thumb on that hand is the worst offender, so it needs to point where the other fingers point. It must not creep behind the ball and flick or push.
3. shooting hand: The first finger (index finger) must be in the center of the ball. It is the one finger that sends the ball where it will go, so it is one of the keys to straightness. If the middle finger is set on the center of the ball, the wrist will be forced to twist. I do allow for the gap between the first two fingers to be in the center of the ball with some players.
4. At the free throw line, the dominant-side foot is slightly forward from the other and the big toe of that foot should be directly in line with the center of the rim.  Be careful if the back foot turns out at all that the shoulders do not follow.  Shoulders staying squared to the basket remains a vital part of shooting straight.
5. It is also important to get leg power, so bending the knees to provide that power helps a lot.  I do not even mind when players jump in a free throw, as long as they do not cross the line, as many younger players will tend to do.  You will find lots of free throws left short if there is no flex at the knees for lift and power.

#1) target: I teach my advanced students to look at the back of the rim and then quickly to the front of the rim on release. That technique tricks the mind into thinking the hoop in larger.
#2) guide hand: The fingers and the thumb are pointing up, with the wrist bent back. The wrist position is important because it prepares the shooter for a full follow through.
#3) shooting hand: The hand is positioned in the middle of the ball and the middle finger is pointed towards the front of the rim at follow through.
#5) feet at the line: I think that the weak foot is a matter of comfort for the shooter. If i were to turn or stagger the weak foot it would be slightly.
#6) The bending of the knees is VITAL to shooting a free throw. When setting up and when going into the shoot. There should be a continous rhythm to the shoot with the release point being just as the knees straighten.

1. The target: I encourage players to look at the back of the rim but honestly if they find the basket early this will be good enough; it is extremely difficult with the speed of the game to find a precise spot when a player goes up to shoot.  On free throws definitely the back of the rim.
2. The guide hand: The guide hand should be on the side of the ball. While most players have most of their guide hand on the side of the ball many start to move some of their fingers to the top of the ball.  At the release the fingers would be straight up and the thumb back at a 45 degree angle. 
3. Position of the shooting hand before releasing: The middle and index fingers will split the middle of the ball.
4. Foot: Alignment is important to reduce muscle tension and therefore I believe the toes of the week foot should be parallel to the instep of the shooting foot. The angle of the hips and torso should correspond to the feet – this way there will no tension in the low back.  Yes, I believe the toe can be turned out slightly but it depends on the flexibility of the hips
5. bending the knees? Is that a very important step?  I think one of the most common mistakes is to bend too deep – the less movement the better.  Therefore I advocate a slight bend in the knees and then a smooth, quick, down movement (so the knees go directly over the toes) and up into the shot.

1) target: I tell them to focus over the front of the rim-trying to land the ball in the middle. But, the most important part is that they keep their eyes on the target and stay focused on that and not letting their head pull off the target and wanting to trace the ball with their eyes from the path of their hand to the basket. By pulling you head off the target your whole upper body and head lean back and it will make the path of the ball fall short.
2) guide hand: The balance-you call it a guide hand-does just that it balances the ball. The ball is placed on your finger pads. Your thumb points directly over your shoulder-you do this to keep from thumbing the ball-and your finger point straight up to the ceiling. And that is exactly how your hand should look when you are finished with your shot. The balance hand should have nothing to do with the trajectory of you shot.
3) shooting hand: Middle finger always tries to find a seam and the ball should always leave that finger last.
4) Your feet are spread apart just outside of your shoulders. Your shooting foot is pointed directly at the middle of the basket and your other foot is slightly staggered back from your shooting foot.



Christopher Thomas 
hoops100@sbcglobal.net  info@100percenthoops.com

1. Here's a test to verify what works best for you. Verbally tell yourself
to look at the front of the rim before you shoot (10) free throws; then do
the same for another (10) free throws but this time tell yourself to look at
the back of the rim and lastly do the same ... but tell yourself look at the
middle. Keep track of what happens on each shot per your visual target.
Funny thing is that the mind can only process one thing at a time so give it
one focus factor.

2. Rule of thumb (literally) is that your thumbs should form a letter "T" on
the ball. Whereas, if you are right handed that thumb will point to the left
as if you are holding a pizza pie in that hand. And your guide hand (left
hand for right handed shooter) point back towards yourself.

3. For the most part yes, I think to have as much hand contact on the ball
is a "feel" preference for shooters. The ball should be relatively centered
on your shooting hand going into the shot.

I teach players to aim right over the front of the rim. I do not teach finger or hand positions as much as I stress repetition and consistency.

Has done basketball shooting instruction in and or with 10 different countries.

Has been a shooting coach for over 22 years!!


STR8 Shooter: ‘What I Look For As A Shooting Coach’

These two points will clean up almost every shot.

by John Townsend / @JTshootingcoach

We have all had those days playing the game of basketball where, for whatever reason, everything just seemed to fall into place. You could see the plays unfold two passes before they actually happened, your defensive anticipation was sharp and of course, your jump shot felt so smooth and easy that an NBA three pointer felt like a 12-foot bank shot. Why is it that those days seem so few and far between? I am going to do the best I can to explain why. Well, at least explain the shooting part.

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is John Townsend. I profess to be a shooting coach and have been for a little over 22 years. I spent the last three seasons as the full-time shooting coach for the Portland Trail Blazers, and I have worked with over 100 NBA players. Of those 100 players, two have been No. 1 picks; four have been NBA All-Stars, one Rookie of the Year and one Gatorade Three-Point Champ. I have also done basketball shooting work in such places as the Canary Islands, the Philippines, United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Ireland, Northern Ireland, England, Spain and Jordan. I have done things with club teams from China and South Korea as well, but domestically here in the US. With all that being said, I am going to give you a good idea how to increase the aforementioned days of shooting great and decrease the days of shooting poorly.

The first thing I am going to look at when watching any player shoot a basketball is the basketball itself. Does the ball go in? If so, case closed. No need for me. If the ball does not go in the basket, where does it go? Does the shot miss left? Does the shot miss right? Long? Short? Of those four different ways to miss a shooter wants to do all he or she can to eliminate missing left and right. After watching the way the ball is missing the basket I will next look at the shooter’s hand, specifically their hand position. When working with any shooter I teach them about the center of the basketball. The center of every basketball is the air nozzle. That is where the shooter’s middle finger needs to be placed when shooting.


Next come’s the shooter’s wrist. What kind of position is the shooting wrist placed? I created an invention, the STR8 SHOOTER, specifically for this purpose, to eliminate ulnar and radial deviation in your shooting wrist. In layman’s terms, any kind of wrist movement to the outside or inside, left or right of your arm. By having a straight wrist it will allow your shooting wrist to “Hammer” back in the shooting motion, like the hammer of a gun (think Steve Nash). If a shooter can achieve this hammering motion, more than likely their wrist is straight. The strongest part of the wrist is the outside. Because the outside is the strongest, most players in general have their wrist slightly bent toward the outside. Keeping your shooting wrist straight will help in shooting the basketball straight.

I know, I know, I never mentioned the word “balance” or “follow through” and nothing even about your shooting elbow. Sorry. That is what you will get from other shooting coaches or basketball coaches in general. Please give these first two teaching points a try — hand position and a straight wrist. The straight wrist will take care of a lot of your shooting woes, especially if you combine that with a “Hammer” in your wrist during your shooting motion. In my 22 years of experience, I have found that these two points will clean up almost every shot.

Do your best to be a STR8 SHOOTER. I will check back here at SLAMonline next week where I hope to outline the second phase of shooting straight.

With over 22 years of experience between the CBA, D-League and NBA, Townsend can be reached at his website jtshooting.com and on Twitter at @JTshootingcoach.

1. The target: Do you focus on the front top of the rim, on the back of the rim or on the middle? That doesn't matter, its for the shooter to decide, I focus on the back

2. The guide hand: Where is the guide hand placed exactly? There is no guide hand, its the non-shooting hand, you can also see this on my video from 1991 The non-shooting hand should be on the side of the ball. Do the fingers and the thumb point up in the air or to the rim when holding the ball/releasing? up in the air

3. Position of the shooting hand before releasing: Are middle and/or index finger in the middle of the ball? yes

4. What do the feet have at the FT line? Paralell to each other or with the weak foot staggered back or turned? See my 1991 video on you tube, one foot can be in front of the other as long as its not over a half-a-foot

5. How important is bending the knees? Its not about bending the knees, its about WHEN the knees bend

6. Do you have some more shooting tipps or handouts? You tube, I am out of posters at the time, but I can send you pictures of posters and you can blow them up to the size you need.

During1987-1991 Jay played four years of high school basketball and averaged 93% from the free throw line.

Throughout his freshman year at Butte College, Jay shot 96.1% making 76 in a row before missing. He finished the season; however, 104-107 which earned him the honor of shooting the best percentage in America at any level (INCLUDING THE NBA) with a minimum of 100 attempts. His free throw shooting prowess continued his sophomore season when he shot 91.8%


In his junior year at Montana State University, Billings Jay set a Pac West Conference record shooting 100% on 38-38 in conference play. Jay's season total was 93.3% on 86-92. That was an NCAA best in 1993-1994.

I have been playing basketball since age 9, that would be around 1958, and my first real game was with 3-dribles, 3 forwards and 3 guards, who could not cross the center line. The game progressed for "women" with rovers and the rest is history.

I played in High school, pre-Title 9, only in a rec-style environment but the boys basketball coach allowed me to practice with the guys. I could out shoot them all but we had some great times. But after joining the Air Force, marrying my recruiter, having a son, and getting divorced, I went back to college at age 25, and got myself back in shape and played 4 years of basketball in California. My first two years were at Fullerton JC, playing on the State champ small college team. Then I was recruited by UCLA, USC, and Long Beach State in 1977, however, I turned down the scholarships and went to a local Christian college because of location and not wanting to commute and leave my son any more than I needed to. My main focus was on being the best Mom I could be and getting my education so I could support my son and myself.

I had a great college career, setting school records, averaging 22 pts a game (pre-three-pointer), shooting 92% from the free throw line my senior year, and playing AAU summer ball with some greats like Ann Meyers, Mavis Washington and others. After graduation I was asked to be the coach at Poly Tech HS in riverside, Calif. where Cheryl Miller was a Freshman. I was also "drafted" by the San Francisco Pioneers (1979). And my 3rd choice was to be the Physical Education teach and coach at a Christian High School in Walnut Creek, Calif.


Realizing that what I wanted to do and should do were in conflict, and having just committed my life and heart to Jesus Christ, I had to look out for what was best for my son and so I chose the full time teaching coaching position. Never a regret because my son received a great Christian education and I enjoyed those years tremendously as a teacher and coach of basketball, volleyball, softball, tennis, etc.

In 1987 the Lord led my son, Steve, and I to Lynchburg, VA, where we currently reside and I became the Assistant Dean of the Distance Learning Program at Liberty University. It was a great job and a great change from smog and traffic to beauty and serenity. However, I was laid off 3 years later when my son was a senior in High school (He is also a b-ball player and we competed in the Commonwealth Games together - our first "games" shooting freethrows and earning gold medals!)


Anyway, after my lay-off, the Lord gave me a vision for a bicycle ministry, since I had become a serious cyclists following a back injury in 1984 which left me incapable of walking for about 6-months. Soon after the lay-off and the completion of a Doctoral degree, I set a World Record on a stationary bicycle (the record has been retired by Guinness years ago because of a couple factors) but none the less a World record. I rode for 22 hours a day and completed 3,000 miles in 7 days, 8 1/2 hours.


Back to basketball..... at about age 55 I heard about Senior Games and was looking for a way to get back into the Game. I had been doing shooting clinics, mostly high school level for many years, and I was offered the position as head basketball coach at Liberty University, a division 1 school in 1989, but decided my coaching days at that level were over.

I participated in the Senior Games in Virginia for the first time in 2006 and shot Free Throws, rode my bicycle, played tennis and table tennis, and met some wonderful folks and was introduced to seniors who played a 3-on-3 half court game. So basketball came back into my life and with it many new friends, a lot of fun, and the opportunity to play as well as help teach many women who played some B-ball but many coming out who wanted to learn.

At the present time I am a very young 61 year old, the grandmother of 2 boys and future basketball stars, and still the proud mother of a wonderful son (who works with me full time in our ministry) and a beautiful daughter-in-law. I still shoot hoops all the time, compete in free throw contests, and usually average 90% from the line.


As a teacher and coach, it is my desire to help everyone I can become a better basketball shooter and player. It is a privilege andblessing to be part of the National Basketaball Shooters Association. Please feel free to contact me for private shooting lessons anytime.

"How Should I Teach My Child To Shoot?"

By coachronn - Posted on January 29th, 2009

Tagged: Offensive Skills

by Scott Jaimet


The author, Scott Jaimet, lives in Oregon. He grew up playing basketball in Indiana. He always wanted to teach his son to shoot but became very frustrated with the lack of knowledge on behalf of most coaches. They could teach the set shot and the bunny hop jumper but no one seemed to know how to teach the big time pull-up jump shot like he saw in the NBA. So he decided to figure it out. He knew that there must be some simple scientific principles that would apply, just as they do in all of the other sports.


“Great coaches make great teams, great parents make great shooters.”

This is one of the truest sayings in basketball. Today’s basketball coach doesn’t have the time and often lacks the knowledge to teach your child to shoot. He only has two hours of practice, three or four days a week to get an entire team ready. He must teach defense, rebounding and offensive patterns to the team which leaves little or no time to teach shooting. So unless your child is very lucky and picks up shooting naturally, you will have a child that plays hard but is not a “shooter”. It’s too bad that basketball has to come to this, when shooting is such an important part of the game, but that’s the way it is.


So if you want your child to have the gift of shooting, you will probably need to get involved. But where and when do you start? The first question that you must answer is what method should he/she learn? How good do you want him/her to be? The answer that I believe is “the best”! Why place a limit on your kid’s ability?

It’s fairly easy to determine what’s best by looking at the NBA and picking out the best shooters and copying their method. That what I did.

Ray Allen, Reggie Miller, Michael Finley, Wally Szczerbiak, Robert Horry, Glen Rice, Oscar Robertson, Walt Frazier and Larry Bird are some of the greatest shooters that I chose to examine. The basic form of all their shots was the same.

he most important part of their shot is, with the ball overhead, when their stroke begins. At this point their shooting hand is flat under the ball, with the shooting elbow at eye level and the arm is bent at the elbow 90º. They are balanced and at the top of their jump. This is the BEST way to shoot a basketball. Now how do we get your child to this point?

Keep it SIMPLE when they are young. Forget the 3-point line! So many kids have bad habits picked up from shooting 3-pointers, that when it is time to teach them a jump shot, they will have a hard time learning,

So when they are young teach them to face the basket with their body in a square position (A). Their feet are on a line perpendicular to the basket with the right foot slightly ahead. Their right arm should be bent at 90º and their shooting wrist wrinkled.

They then start the shot by bending their knees (B) and simultaneously bringing the ball up. Their shooting arm first moves under the ball. They then push up through the bottom of the ball (C).

Then, as they leave the floor in their jump (D), the arm unfolds and extends toward the basket, resulting in a nice shot that has a good arc on it.

They end up holding their follow-through with their fingers dipped in the basket (E).

Their landing is square and balanced. It is important that you always stress that they focus on being balanced in their technique.

That’s it! That’s all you need to teach them until they are twelve to fourteen years old and strong enough to shoot a JUMP shot. Always teach your child to focus on their shooting form. Let their form determine how far they shoot from. If a longer distance forces them to alter their technique, make them stop. Distance will come later.

When they are older, stronger and ready to shoot a JUMP shot is when your real work as a parent begins. Either hire a shooting coach or get involved. A great guide for you as the coach of your child is, The Perfect Jump Shot: The Science and Art of Shooting a Basketball.
